## Contents
- Raw data used in the analysis
- Jupyter notebook to reproduce the results and figures from the paper

## Overview
1. The aging dataset is divided into SOH segments.
2. A machine learning model is trained for each SOH segment.
3. Model explainability methods are used to identify which cycling parameters contribute most to aging at each SOH level.

## Requirements
Python 3.8 or later  
Suggested packages:  
- numpy  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- shap  
- matplotlib  

## How to Use
Open the notebook and run all cells to reproduce the analysis.
